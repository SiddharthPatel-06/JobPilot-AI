## ✨ What is JobPilot AI?

## Why I Built This

Job hunting is repetitive and time-consuming. Most platforms require manual applications and resume customization.  
I wanted to create something:

- Fast and automated
- Smart with AI suggestions
- Minimalist yet powerful

With auto-apply, AI resume and cover letter generator, and mock interview support — **JobPilot AI saves time and improves job success chances**.
